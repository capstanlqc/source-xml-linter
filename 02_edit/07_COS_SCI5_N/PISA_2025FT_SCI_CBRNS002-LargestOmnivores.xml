                <text><h1>Largest Omnivores</h1><div><p>Whale sharks are omnivores that live in the coastal waters of tropical and warm temperate seas.</p><p>They are the largest shark species and so are classified as fish. They are given the name ‘whale’ because of their size.</p><p>These sharks feed by filtering seawater to capture food.</p><p>Until recently, they were thought to only eat plankton (microscopic plants and animals), krill (small, shrimp-like crustaceans) and larger animals such as squid and small fish.</p><p>However, a recent study has found that whale sharks also eat large amounts of macroalgae (large seaweeds).</p></div><img src="" alt="CBRN002S1_largest-omnivores.jpg" width="100%"/>‌Whale sharks in the Bohol Sea, Philippines</text>
